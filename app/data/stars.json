    "description": "The ARB_48_IN_LIDAR data set contains data collected from a 48-inch lidar system located at NASA Langley Research Center. Each granule consists of one year of data. The days of data are different in each granule. Each measurement consists of four parameters: stratospheric integrated backscatter over altitude, altitude levels, scattering ratio at each altitude level, and aerosol backscattering coefficient at each altitude level. An image was produced to represent the data collected for each granule.The Aerosol Research Branch (ARB) Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) project has been taking ground based LIDAR measurements from Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia since May 1974. These LIDAR measurements provide high resolution vertical profiles of the upper tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols. The LIDAR system has evolved over the years and provides a valuable long-term history of the middle-latitude stratospheric aerosol.The measurements for ARB were made using a LIDAR system. This system uses a ruby laser that emits one joule per pulse with a repeat rate of 0.15 hertz (Hz) at a wavelength of 0.6943 micrometers. This system also uses a 48-inch cassegrainian configured telescope mounted on a movable platform. The transmitter laser beam has a divergence of about 1.0 mrad, and the maximum receiver field of view is 4.0 mrad. The LIDAR has a signal bandwidth of 1 MHz, and this is equal to a 150 meter vertical resolution. Three photomultiplier tubes are used to enhance the dynamic range. These tubes are electronically switched on at specific times after the laser has been fired. The photomultiplier tube output signals are processed by 12-bit Computer Automated Measurement and Control (CAMAC) based digitizers and acquired by a personal computer. The data are archived on optical discs.",

Data acquired by the MAS are helping to define, develop, and test algorithms for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), a key sensor of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS). The MODIS program will emphasize the use of remotely sensed data to monitor variation in environmental conditions for assessing both natural and human-induced global change.      The MAS spectrometer acquires high spatial resolution imagery in the range of 0.55 to 14.3 microns. A total of 50 spectral bands are available in this range. Pre-1995 the digitizer was configured for each mission to record a pre-selected group of 12 bands during the flight. For most of these missions the digitizer was configured to record four 10-bit channels and seven 8-bit channels. A 50-channel digitizer which records all 50 spectral bands at 12 bit resolution became operational in January 1995.      The MAS spectrometer is mated to a scanner sub-assembly which collects image  with an IFOV of 2.5 mrad, giving a ground resolution of 50 meters from 20000 meters altitude, and a cross track scan width of 85.92 degrees.",

    "description": "The SSM/I Derived Oceanic Monthly Rainfall Indices data set is a GlobalbPrecipitaton Climate Project (GPCP) product. Monthly rainfall indices overnthe oceans are derived from Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites F8 and F11 on channels 19 and 22 V. The data set covers the period from July 1987 to December 1995.\n      \n      The monthly rainfall indices are on a 5 degree by 5 degree grid extending from 50 N to 50 S. The Wilheit, Chang and Chiu (1991) method used to derive the indices gives valid values only over ocean areas. Land pixels (including island pixels) and erroneous pixels return a -10 flag. The data are stored on a 72 x 20 grid. Grid point (1,1) contains the index for 45-50 N, 0-5 E, grid point (2,1) contains the index for 45-50 N, 5-10 E, ... and grid point (72,20) contains the index for 45-50 S, 175-180 W.\n      \n      In the data set, each month starts with an ASCII header to identify the year and month. The data is in 10F8.1 format. Each value is the average of AM and PM estimates and corrected for beam filling error. The equation used is: (AM PM)/2.0 * 1.8. Land pixels are set to -10.0. Also there are 33 pixels blocked out due to island contamination (-10.0). If the rain retrieval did not converge, a -10.0 is assigned to the pixel.\n      \n      The objective of this data set is to provide a long term monthly rainfall data set to be used in EOS global change and GEWEX related research. The data set can be accessed through the IMS. Data maintained in an off-line archive will also be listed in the IMS, and orders will be filled as the data is requested. The SSM/I Derived Oceanic Monthly Rainfall Indices data set will be reviewed every six months to ensure that the most current version of the data is available.",

The HIRS was designed to measure surface temperature and albedo, temperature and H2O profiles, cloud liquid water content, cloud amount and outgoing longwave fluxes in the infrared. The data, originally written on IBM 360 machines, were recovered from 9-track magnetic tapes. The data are archived in their original IBM 32-bit word binary record format, also referred to as a binary TAP file, and contain one orbit of measurements.The HIRS experiment on Nimbus-6 is a follow on to the successful Nimbus-5 ITPR experiment.  HIRS was a multi-channel filter radiometer with a Cassegrain telescope before the chopper assembly. The instrument scans in the cross track direction with 21 scans on each side of the subtrack point with about 30 km x 55 km resolution at nadir. HIRS measured radiances primarily in five spectral regions: (1) seven channels near the 15-micrometer CO2 absorption band, (2) two channels (11.1 and 3.7 micrometers) in the IR window, (3) two channels (8.2 and 6.7 micrometers) in the water vapor absorption band, (4) five channels in the 4.3-micrometer band, and (5) one channel in the visible 0.69-micrometer region.The HIRS Principal Investigator was Mr. W. L. Smith from the NOAA National Environmental Satellite Service. The Nimbus-6 HIRS data are available from August 17, 1975 (day of year 229) through March 4, 1976 (day of year 238).These data were previously archived at NASA NSSDC under the entry ID ESAD-00017 together with the merged retrieval data set).",

This data set utilizes the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI; spatial resolution: 250m) for the winter growing season (October-March). The methodology uses an automated algorithm identifying the EVI peak in each pixel for each year and linearly scales the EVI value between 0% and 100% cropped area within that particular pixel. Maps were then resampled to 1 km and were validated using high-resolution QuickBird, RapidEye, SkySat, and WorldView-2 images spanning 2008 to 2016 across 11 different agricultural regions of India. The spatial resolution of the data set is 1 km, resampled from 250m. The data are distributed as GeoTIFF and NetCDF files and are in WGS 84 projection.",

    "description": "LITE_L1 data are LIDAR Vertical profile data along the orbital flight path of STS-64.Lidar In-Space Technology Experiment (LITE) used a three-wavelength (355 nm, 532 nm and 1064 nm) backscatter lidar which flew on the space shuttle Discovery as part of the STS-64 mission between September 9 and September 20, 1994. The LITE instrument was designed with the capability to make measurements of clouds, aerosols in the stratosphere and troposphere, the height of the planetary boundary layer, and atmospheric temperature and density in the stratosphere between 25 km and 40 km altitude. Additionally, limited measurements of the surface return strength over both land and ocean were collected to explore retrievals of surface properties.The LITE data were transmitted real time the by Ku-band system through TDRSS downlink to the LITE operations center at JSC. There was a gap in the high-rate coverage between 60 E and 85 E due to the zone of exclusion, where neither TDRSS satellite was in view. Additional random gaps in the data occurred due to telemetry dropouts during data transmission.The LITE L1 data product was formed by processing and reformatting the LITE high-rate telemetry data. The LITE L1 processing steps included:Correcting the profiles for instrument artifacts.  Subtracting the DC offset from each lidar profile. Interpolating lidar profiles to a geolocated, common altitude grid, which extends from -4.985 to 40.0 km with a 15 m vertical resolution.  Determining the LITE system calibration constants for the 355 nm and 532 nm wavelength profiles.Merged with the LITE L1 lidar profiles are:     Identification Parameters,     Time Parameters,     Location Parameters,     Operation Mode Parameters,     Validity Flags,     Measurement Location Descriptions,     Temperature and Pressure Profiles Derived from NMC Data,     Instrument Status Information.The archived files are concatenations of about 1000 (depending on data gaps) sets of headers and profiles.

The calibrated radiances are measured at 6 channels from 2.3 to 15 micrometers with a ground resolution of 25 km, and are \"declouded\" (interpolated and smoothed across regions of cloud). The radianes were used to obtain the temperatures of six successive 10-km layers of the atmosphere from earth or cloudtop level to 60-km height. The data were recovered from the original 9-track tapes, and are now stored onlin as daily files in their original proprietary binary format with about 14 orbits per day.               \n\nSpatial coverage is near global from latitude -80 to +80 degrees. The data are available from 27 July 1970 (day of year 208) to 20 February 1973 (day of year 51). The channel 1 temperature monitoring system failed on June 15, 1970, thereby reducing the accuracy of the SCR data. Channels 3 and 4 became noisy and unusable on April 18, 1972.

    "description": "The TC4 AMPR Brightness Temperature (TB) dataset consists of brightness temperature data from July 19, 2007 through August 8, 2007. The Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4) mission field experiment was completed during July and August 2007 was based out of San Jose, Costa Rica. The Advanced Microwave Precipitation Radiometer (AMPR) instrument played a key role in the experiment. The AMPR remotely senses passive microwave signatures of geophysical parameters from an airborne platform. The instrument is a low noise system which can provide multi-frequency microwave imagery with high spatial and temporal resolution. AMPR data were collected at a combination of frequencies (10.7, 19.35, 37.1, and 85.5 GHz) unique to current NASA aircraft instrumentation. These frequencies are well suited to the study of rain cloud systems, but are also useful to studies of various ocean and land surface processes.",

The fifth in an ongoing series of ER-2 field experiments, THORpex is the primary over-water validation experiment for the GIFTS (Geosynchronous Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer) satellite.      The MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) is an airborne scanning spectrometer that acquires high spatial resolution imagery of cloud and surface features from its vantage point on-board a NASA ER-2 high-altitude research aircraft.      The MAS spectrometer acquires high spatial resolution imagery in the range of 0.55 to 14.3 microns. A total of 50 spectral bands are available in this range. A 50-channel digitizer which records all 50 spectral bands at 12 bit resolution became operational in January 1995.      The MAS spectrometer is mated to a scanner sub-assembly which collects image data with an IFOV of 2.5 mrad, giving a ground resolution of 50 meters from 20000 meters altitude, and a cross track scan width of 85.92 degrees.",
